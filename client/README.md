## üí∞ AdSense Setup Instructions

3. ‚úÖ Publisher ID configured: `ca-pub-2641120743401922`

### 2. Configure AdSense in Your App ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Update Publisher ID ‚úÖ DONE

Your Publisher ID `ca-pub-2641120743401922` has been configured in:

1. ‚úÖ **`app/layout.tsx`** - AdSense script loaded
2. ‚úÖ **`components/AdSense.tsx`** - Publisher ID set

#### Configure Ad Slots ‚è≥ NEXT STEP

**To complete your AdSense setup:**

1. Go to your [Google AdSense Dashboard](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Navigate to "Ads" ‚Üí "Ad units"
3. Create 4 new ad units:

   - **Banner Ad** (Responsive) - for header
   - **In-Article Ad** (In-article) - for content sections
   - **Square Ad** (300x250) - for sidebar/footer
   - **Display Ad** (Responsive) - for general placement

4. Copy each ad unit's slot ID and replace in `components/AdComponents.tsx`:
   - **BannerAd**: Line 8 - Replace `"1234567890"`
   - **SidebarAd**: Line 18 - Replace `"2345678901"`
   - **SquareAd**: Line 28 - Replace `"3456789012"`
   - **InArticleAd**: Line 38 - Replace `"4567890123"`

üí° **Tip**: You can use "Auto ads" initially and create specific ad units later for better control.

### üîß **AdSense Development Mode**

**Fixed Issue**: AdSense errors in development mode have been resolved!

- ‚úÖ **Development**: Shows placeholder ads instead of real ads
- ‚úÖ **Production**: Loads real AdSense ads automatically
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Prevents "adsbygoogle already have ads" errors
- ‚úÖ **React Safe**: Handles component re-renders properly

**What you'll see:**

- **Local Development** (`npm run dev`): Gray placeholder boxes with slot information
- **Production Build** (`npm run build`): Real AdSense ads once deployed

### 3. Set Up Analytics (Optional but Recommended)

Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` in `app/layout.tsx` with your Google Analytics ID for better tracking.
